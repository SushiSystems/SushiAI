# tests/layers/nn/test_upsample2d.cpp


Suites: `Small_Upsample2d`.

Tests the shape, layout and rejections of the Upsample2d layer.

This file needs no device. `NN::Upsample2d` in `modules/layers/nn/include/SushiAI/nn/upsample2d.hpp` holds one
integer scale, 2 by default, and no parameter. It repeats every pixel of an NHWC image over a
scale-by-scale block.

Two `static_assert` lines at file scope require `Upsample2d` to be a `Module` and not a
`ModuleContainer`.

## traced_per_sample_shape

`traced_per_sample_shape` traces a layer over a new input of the given batched shape and
returns the result's shape with the batch axis dropped. The forward rejection cases call it
too, since it throws whatever `forward()` throws.

## K_OVERFLOWING_SCALE

`K_OVERFLOWING_SCALE` is 2^62. Its product with an extent of 5 does not fit in 64 bits.

## TheDefaultScaleDoublesHeightAndWidth

A default layer traces a [2, 3, 5, 7] input to [2, 6, 10, 7].

## TheScaleFieldSetsTheFactorOnBothSpatialAxes

`Upsample2d{3}` traces a [1, 4, 2, 5] input to [1, 12, 6, 5].

## TheResultIsTaggedNHWC

The traced result is rank 4 and tagged NHWC.

## ForwardEmitsOneUpsampleNodeCarryingTheScale

The trace of `Upsample2d{3}` adds exactly one node. The producer of the result is an
K_UPSAMPLE2D whose one operand is the input, and attribute slots 0 and 1 both hold 3.

## OutputShapeScalesHeightAndWidthOnly

A default layer maps [3, 5, 7] to [6, 10, 7], and `Upsample2d{4}` maps [2, 1, 9] to [8, 4, 9].
The channel extent is unchanged in both.

## OutputShapeAgreesWithTheTracedShape

For scales 2, 3 and 1, `output_shape()` equals the traced shape without its batch axis. A
scale of 1 is the smallest the layer accepts and leaves the shape as it is.

## OutputShapeRejectsAZeroScale

`Upsample2d{0}.output_shape([3, 5, 7])` throws with a message containing "Upsample2d" and
"[3, 5, 7] with scale=0".

## OutputShapeRejectsANegativeScale

`Upsample2d{-2}.output_shape([3, 5, 7])` throws with a message containing "Upsample2d" and
"[3, 5, 7] with scale=-2".

## OutputShapeRejectsARankOnePerSampleShape

`output_shape([16])` throws with a message containing "Upsample2d", the expected form
"[H, W, C]" and "[16]".

## OutputShapeRejectsAScaledHeightThatOverflows

With `K_OVERFLOWING_SCALE`, `output_shape([5, 1, 7])` throws with a message containing
"Upsample2d" and "fit in 64 bits". The width is 1, so the height is the product that
overflows.

## OutputShapeRejectsARankFourShape

`output_shape([2, 3, 5, 7])` throws. The shape still carries its batch axis.

## ForwardRejectsAZeroScale

`forward()` of `Upsample2d{0}` over a [1, 2, 2, 3] input throws with a message containing
"Upsample2d" and "[2, 2, 3] with scale=0".

## ForwardRejectsARankTwoInput

`forward()` over a [2, 12] input throws with a message containing "Upsample2d", "rank-4" and
"[2, 12]".

## ForwardRejectsAScaledWidthThatOverflows

With `K_OVERFLOWING_SCALE`, `forward()` over a [1, 1, 5, 3] input throws with a message
containing "Upsample2d" and "fit in 64 bits". The height is 1, so the width is the product
that overflows.

## ForwardRejectsAnNCHWInput

A [1, 3, 2, 2] input is converted to NCHW, and `forward()` throws with a message containing
"upsample2d" and "NHWC". The lower-case name is the builder's: `GraphBuilder::upsample2d`
raises this message.

## TheParameterWalkVisitsNothing

After a trace the walk visits nothing and `parameter_count` is 0.
